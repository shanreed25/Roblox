# ðŸ“œ Workig With Scripts
- used to add custom behaviors and interactivity to a Roblox experience, allowing developers to automate actions, respond to player input, create game mechanics like leaderboards, and control NPCs
- [More About Scripts](../Getting%20Started/Scripts.md)
- To understand how scripts work you must understand the [Client-Server Model](./ClientServerModel.md) that Roblox uses

## âœ¨ Roblox Scripts
- **Can be categorized into three main types:** 
    - [Server Scripts](./ServerScripts.md)
        - for server-side actions affecting all players
    - [LocalScripts](./LocalScripts.md)
        - for player-specific actions visible only to that client
    - [ModuleScripts](./ModuleScripts.md)
        - for organizing and reusing code across other scripts
