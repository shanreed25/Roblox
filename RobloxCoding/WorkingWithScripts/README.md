# ðŸ“œ Workig With Scripts
- used to add custom behaviors and interactivity to a Roblox experience, allowing developers to automate actions, respond to player input, create game mechanics like leaderboards, and control NPCs
- [More About Scripts](../Getting%20Started/Scripts.md)
- To understand how scripts work you must understand the [Client-Server Model](./ClientServerModel.md) that Roblox uses

## âœ¨ Roblox Scripts
- **Can be categorized into three main types:** 
    - [Server Scripts](#server-scripts)
    - [LocalScripts](#localscripts)
    - [ModuleScripts](#modulescripts)

### ðŸ¥‡ Server Scripts
- for server-side actions affecting all players
- run on the game's server and affect all players, handling shared game logic. 

### ðŸ¥ˆ LocalScripts
- for player-specific actions visible only to that client
- run on a player's client, affecting only that specific user and used for UI or player-specific features. 

### ðŸ¥‰ ModuleScripts
- for organizing and reusing code across other scripts
- are for code organization and reusability, allowing other scripts to call their functions.
