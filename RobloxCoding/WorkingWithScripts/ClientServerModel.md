# Multi-Player Model: Server Client Model
- any Roblox game follows this model
- **SERVER:** reserved section of a game that oversees the whole game
    - camera is directed over the entire game, not one specific player
    - controls everything that happens with the game
    - controls synchronization among all players of the game
    - **replcation:** when something happens in the server, it will be replicated to be shown to every player in the server from their point of view
    - **transmitting data:**
        - **Server Scripts:** from the server to all clients
            - if we want to change something through a script, that is replicated(shown) for all players
        - **Local Scripts:** from the server to one client
            - if we want to change something through a script, that is replicated(shown) for only one player
        - from one client(player) to the server
- **Client:** is like each individual player and they each connect to the client
    - camera is directed towards the player
    - they see every thing from their point of view
