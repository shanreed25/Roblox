# üìú Scripts
**Instructions that we give to the computer so the computer knows what to do**
- used to add custom behaviors and interactivity to a Roblox experience, allowing developers to automate actions, respond to player input, create game mechanics like leaderboards, and control NPCs
- they instruct the Roblox engine to perform operations on its data model
- Scripts use Luau, a language based on Lua, to define instructions for the game. 
- **Can be categorized into three main types:** 
    - **Server Scripts:** for server-side actions affecting all players
        - run on the game's server and affect all players, handling shared game logic. 
    - **LocalScripts:** for player-specific actions visible only to that client
        - run on a player's client, affecting only that specific user and used for UI or player-specific features. 
    - **ModuleScripts:** for organizing and reusing code across other scripts
        - are for code organization and reusability, allowing other scripts to call their functions. 

## üëÅÔ∏è How Roblox Scripts Work
- **Programming Language:** Scripts use Luau, a language based on Lua, to define instructions for the game. 
- **Engine Interaction:** Scripts interact with the Roblox engine's [data model](./DataModel.md) to manipulate game elements and trigger events. 

### Simulate and Test
**To "simulate" your scripts in Roblox, you need to run the game or use the dedicated testing modes in Roblox Studio to see your scripts in action and check for errors.**
- allows you to test how your Luau code behaves in a live, or simulated multi-client, environment, helping you debug and refine your scripts before publishing your game to the public
- **Test (or Play):**starts a playtest by inserting your avatar at a designated spawn location within your game
    - simulates a player joining the game as they would on the Roblox platform, starting from a spawn point.
- **Test Here (or Play Here):** starts a playtest by inserting your avatar directly in front of the camera's current position in the Studio view
    - useful for quickly testing specific areas or elements of your game without needing to navigate from a spawn point
- **Run:** starts the game simulation without inserting your avatar
    - the playtest begins at the current camera position, and you can navigate around the environment using the camera controls
    - this mode is primarily used for testing scripts, physics, and other game mechanics without the influence of a player character
    - you can observe how objects fall or how scripts interact with the environment without an avatar present. 
- **Servers & Clients:** refer to the distinct computing environments within these simulations
