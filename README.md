# ðŸ’Ž Beginners Guide to Roblox Development
**This is a comprehensive educational repository designed for beginners learning Lua scripting and game development in Roblox. The repository is structured to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical, hands-on experience through real game projects.**


### ðŸ“š Code Guides Folder
**Fundamental Lua programming concepts**
- **Basic Programming Concepts:** variables, functions, logical operators, relational operators etc....
- **Control Flow:** Loops (for, while, nested), conditionals, and flow control (break/continue)
- **Roblox-Specific Topics:** Working with game objects, properties, and the Workspace
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Player events, touch events, and callback functions

### ðŸŽ® Games
**Practical projects for applying learned concepts**
- **Obstacle Course Game:** A complete game project with multiple versions showing progression
- **Ramp Game:** Another game project with modular components and kill zones
**Versioned Development:** Shows how projects evolve with version1, version2 directories

### Progressive Learning Approach
**Starts with basic Lua concepts and builds up to complex game mechanics**
- **Hands-On Projects:** Real Roblox games that demonstrate practical application of programming concepts
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Focus on Roblox's event system (touched events, player events)
- **Modular Design:** Games are broken down into reusable components and scripts
- **Version Control:** Multiple versions of projects show development progression

### Key Features:
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Starts with basic concepts like variables and functions
- **Roblox-Specific:** Uses actual Roblox API calls (game.Workspace, Color3.new(), Material properties)
- **Interactive Elements:** Touch events, kill zones, and player interaction systems
- **Documentation:** README files and inline comments explain concepts and implementations
