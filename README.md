- [Getting Started: Roblox Studio](./RobloxCoding/GettingStarted.md)
    - Learn how to get started coding in Roblox Studio
- [Client Server Model](./Concepts/ClientServerModel.md)
    - Learn about the Client Server model Roblox uses by default for all experiences
- [Data Model](./Concepts/DataModel.md)
    - Learn about the root Instance of Roblox's parent/child hierarchy
- [Scripts](./Concepts/Scripts/README.md)
    - Learn what scripts are and how they instruct the Roblox engine to perform operations
- [Working With Scripts](./RobloxCoding/ExampleScripts/)
    - **Fundamental Lua coding concepts:** variables, functions, logical operators, relational operators etc....
    - **Control Flow:** Loops (for, while, nested), conditionals, and flow control (break/continue)
    - **Event-Driven Programming:** Player events, touch events, and callback functions
    - **Garbage Collection:** handling unnecessary or unneeded objects or instances
- [Roblox-Specific Topics](./Concepts/README.md)
    - Data, and Client Server Models, Scripts, Task Scheduler
    - Working with game objects, properties, and the Workspace


### ðŸŽ® [Games](./Games/README.md)
**Practical projects for applying learned concepts**
- **Versioned Development:** Shows how projects evolve with version1, version2 directories

### ðŸš€ Progressive Learning Approach
**Starts with basic Lua concepts and builds up to complex game mechanics**
- **Hands-On Projects:** Real Roblox games that demonstrate practical application of programming concepts
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Focus on Roblox's event system (touched events, player events)
- **Modular Design:** Games are broken down into reusable components and scripts
- **Version Control:** Multiple versions of projects show development progression

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Starts with basic concepts like variables and functions
- **Roblox-Specific:** Uses actual Roblox API calls (game.Workspace, Color3.new(), Material properties)
- **Interactive Elements:** Touch events, kill zones, and player interaction systems
- **Documentation:** README files and inline comments explain concepts and implementations
